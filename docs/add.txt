To run kernel in a VM (Virtual Machine), run ./scripts/run-vm.sh
-- Possible Parameters include -clean (clears previous build), -safe (runs safely)

Full Kernel is located in ./kernel

Apps / Packages for ISO build need to be included in ./apps

If you recieve this error when compiling the kernel: "[ERROR] Retry to mount disk image failed. Check if the disk image is corrupted or in use."
Try re-running the script and it may work.
